# HokiGuessr
A real-time Finnish Elite League (Liiga) goal scorer guessing application. Done as a full-stack school project using React, Node.js and MySQL.

# How to play?
The idea of the game is to guess which players score goals on a Liiga hockey match. Predicting is done with in-game currency called pucks. To earn pucks, you have to guess right goal scorers. By default, each player has a puck return ratio of 2, but admin user can set custom ratios for players.
